# InterpKit v1.1

`InterpKit` is a CLI (Command Line Interface) helper tool designed to speed up and simplify data lookup from engineering tables, especially the `d/L` function table for increments of `d/L`0.

This program was created to overcome the slow and error-prone manual process of finding upper and lower boundary values from tables, which are then used for linear interpolation calculations.

-----

## Main Features

  * **Modern CLI Interface:** A clean and functional interactive interface.
  * **Fast Search:** Instantly finds the upper and lower boundary data rows based on your input value.
  * **Interpolation Calculator:** Automatically performs linear interpolation once the boundary data is found.

## How to Install (windows).
```bash
winget install lainx86.InterpKit
```
